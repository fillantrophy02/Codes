	<p>One day, the dragon discovered a treasure trove in a random cave. "Gold!" it exclaimed as it rubbed the finest crowns and jewels. Unfortunately, the little dragon was too small to carry these treasures out of the trove.</p>

	<p>In the end, when the dragon succesfully became as big as a mountain and returned to the trove, it found out that it could no longer fit in the cave.It flew away in sadness.</p>
	<p>The moral of the story is to <b>do everything in moderation.</b></p>
